# BlazorCRUDThreeTiered

# WHAT IS THREE TIERED ARCHITECTURE?
•	It divides application into three interconnected layers.
o	Presentation Layer: The user interface where the end-user interacts with the system (e.g., a web browser or a mobile app).
o	Logic Layer: The middle tier of the architecture, also known as the logic tier, handles the application’s core processing, business rules, and calculations.
o	Data Layer: Manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of the application’s data, typically utilizing a database.

# Advantages
1.	Allows for scalability since each tier can be scaled independently to meet changing performance demands.
2.	Highly flexible; tiers can be updated or replaced with newer technologies without disrupting the entire application.
3.	Maintainability is enhanced, as modifications to one tier often have minimal or no effect on other tiers.
4.	Improved security, as multiple layers of protection can be implemented to safeguard sensitive data and business logic.
