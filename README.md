# Blazor Employee CRUD
Blazor is a .NET frontend web framework that supports both server-side rendering and client interactivity in a single programming model:

* Create rich interactive UIs using C#.
* Share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.
* Render the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers.
* Build hybrid desktop and mobile apps with .NET and Blazor.

# WHAT IS THREE TIERED ARCHITECTURE?
It divides application into three interconnected layers.
* <b>Presentation Layer:</b> The user interface where the end-user interacts with the system (e.g., a web browser or a mobile app).
* <b>Logic Layer:</b> The middle tier of the architecture, also known as the logic tier, handles the application’s core processing, business rules, and calculations.
* <b>Data Layer:</b> Manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of the application’s data, typically utilizing a database.

# Advantages
* <b>Allows for scalability</b> since each tier can be scaled independently to meet changing performance demands.
* <b>Highly flexible</b>; tiers can be updated or replaced with newer technologies without disrupting the entire application.
* <b>Maintainability</b> is enhanced, as modifications to one tier often have minimal or no effect on other tiers.
* <b>Improved security</b>, as multiple layers of protection can be implemented to safeguard sensitive data and business logic.
